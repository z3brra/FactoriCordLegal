# 2. Description of the Service

FactoriCord is a **decentralized SaaS platform** that connects **Factorio servers** to **Discord**.
It allows automatic synchronization of in-game events (joins, deaths, chat, etc.) to Discord channels managed
by FactoriCord bot.

The Service consists of :
- A **central coordination API** hosted by the FactoriCord Team
- A **client agent** running on the user's VPS (communicating through secure HTTPS requests)
- A **Discoord bot** integrated with the use's Discord server
- A **Factorio mod** responsible for local data collection (logs only)

The platform is provided **"as-is"**, without warranty of uninterrupted operation.


# 3. Eligibility and Account Linking

To use FactoriCord :
- You must be the owner or administrator of the Discord server where the bot is installed.
- You must have access to a **VPS or dedicated server** running Factorio.
- By registering via the ``!register`` command, you authorize the creation of a unique **server token** linking your Discord server and your Factorio server.

Each token is :
- **Unique** per Discord-Factorio pair
- **Non-transferable**
- **Revocable** at any time by the FactoriCord Team in case of abuse or violation

The registration and linking process operates as follows :
1. The user **invites the bot** to a Discord server.
2. The user runs the ``!register`` command.
3. The bot calls the **Central API**, which generates a **unique server token**.
4. The API responds with this token, securely linked to the Discord guild.
5. The bot displays a personalized installation command for the user‚Äôs VPS.
6. The user runs the installer, which:
    - Installs required dependencies (Python)
    - Downloads the Client API source folder
    - Sets up a systemd service
7. The Client API authenticates to the Central API using the token, completing the registration.
8. From then on, the bot relays in-game events from the linked Factorio server to Discord.

This onboarding flow forms part of the contractual use of FactoriCord.
By completing it, the user explicitly agrees to data processing and linkage as described in the Privacy Policy
